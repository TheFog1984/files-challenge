Hi TA. I don't know your name since I wasn't able to attend the first two classes.

My name is Geoff. I just finished my first year of the MDes (Master of Design) program in Interaction Design. Turns out I like the techincal side more than the design part!

I look forward to meeting you. This class seems like a lot of fun! Do you have any experience with D3.js?
